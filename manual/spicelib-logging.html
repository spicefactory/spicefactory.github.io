<h1><a name="intro"></a>22 Logging for Flash Applications</h1>

<p class="paragraph">The logging framework allows to log custom messages from application code and use 
the configuration options to filter log output based on logger names and log levels.
It was first developed in AS2 and used in inhouse projects for more than three years until
we ported it to AS3 and included it in the public Spicelib release.</p>

<p class="paragraph">It is currently maintained primarily for use in Flash Applications. 
The Flex SDK has its own Logging API which you can use when building Flex Applications.</p>
<h2><a name="application"></a>22.1 Adding log statements to application code</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Usually you would just create a constant that holds the logger for your particular class:</p>

<pre><code>private static const log : Logger = LogContext.getLogger(MyClass);
</code></pre>  

<p class="paragraph"> You can just pass a <code>Class</code> instance to the <code>getLogger</code> method. In this case
the fully qualified class name would be used as the name for the logger.
Of course you could use any name you want (specified as a String) or create more that one logger for a class, 
but using
the class name is the most common usage. The static <code>getLogger</code> method of the <code>LogContext</code>
class uses the default <code>LogFactory</code> under the hood. This is not required but it makes sure that
your application logs use the same configuration and appenders than the internal logs of all Spicefactory
projects. Alternatively you could also instantiate and use a custom <code>LogFactory</code> and configure 
it separately.</p> 

<p class="paragraph">You could then use that <code>Logger</code> instance anywhere in the class:</p>

<pre><code>public function loadProject (id:String) : void {
    log.info("Start loading project with id {0}", id);
    // do something
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a name="levels"></a>22.2 Log levels</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Log levels offer a way to organize log statements into a hierarchy of different severities.
The logging configuration (explained in the next section) allows to filter the log output
based on Logger names and levels.
The framework supports the following log levels (semantics borrowed from log4j and other existing frameworks):</p>

<table>
<tr><td> FATAL </td><td> Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> ERROR </td><td> Error events that might still allow the application to continue running. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> WARN </td><td> Potentially harmful situations. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> INFO </td><td> Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> DEBUG </td><td> Fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> TRACE </td><td> Very fine-grained information (represents the lowest rank of all levels). </td></tr> 
</table>
<h2><a name="config"></a>22.3 Configuration</h2>

<p class="paragraph">There are two ways to configure the logging framework: Parsley XML and programmatic configuration.</p>


<h3><a name="config_parsley"></a>22.3.1 Using Parsley XML Tags</h3>

<p class="paragraph">If you are using Parsley anyway, using its XML configuration is probably the most convenient way.
You can maintain different configuration files for each developer of the project and change it frequently 
without recompiling. See <a href="logging.php#flash">15.2&nbsp;Logging Configuration for Flash</a> for details.</p>


<h3><a name="config_programmatic"></a>22.3.2 Programmatic Configuration</h3>

<p class="paragraph">If you don't use Parsley for application configuration it is recommended to configure
logging programmatically since you would pull in the whole Parsley library otherwise.
An example setup could look like this:</p> 

<pre><code>var factory:FlashLogFactory = new DefaultLogFactory();

factory.setRootLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN);
factory.addLogLevel("com.mycompany.mypackage.controller", LogLevel.DEBUG);
factory.addLogLevel("com.mycompany.mypackage.services", LogLevel.DEBUG);

var traceApp:Appender = new TraceAppender();
traceApp.threshold = LogLevel.TRACE;
factory.addAppender(traceApp);

LogContext.factory = factory;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">This block should execute once on application startup.</p>
<h2><a name="customize"></a>22.4 Customizing the Logging Framework</h2>

<p class="paragraph">The most common use case for customizing the logging framework would be to implement your own
<code>Appender</code>. This might be necessary if you have some special requirements like the need
to send log statements over a socket connection for example. Implementing the <code>Appender</code>
interface is quite straightforward. You can look at the source of Spicelibs existing two implementations.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If you need even more flexibility you could also develop your own implementations of the 
<code>Logger</code> and <code>LogFactory</code> interfaces, but that might be a rather rare scenario.</p>  

<p class="paragraph">In the future we might add more <code>Appender</code> implementations to Spicelib like a 
<code>FileAppender</code> for AIR applications or even might look into integrating with the Flex Logging
Framework.</p>
