<h1><a name="intro"></a>2 Getting Started</h1>

<p class="paragraph">This chapter gives a very quick introduction on how to build a simple application with Parsley,
linking to other parts of the manual for more detailed descriptions. Most of the explanations
apply in the same way to building Flex or Flash Applications. Examples that only apply
for Flex development will be pointed out accordingly.</p>
<h2><a name="sample"></a>2.1 Hello World Sample Application</h2>

<p class="paragraph">If you prefer to examine a simple sample application before reading the manual,
you can find a Hello World sample <a href="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/docs/2.3/samples/helloworld/HelloWorld.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
"View Source" is enabled.</p>

<p class="paragraph">This chapter does not reflect the sample application though.</p>
<h2><a name="setup"></a>2.2 Adding the Framework SWCs</h2>

<p class="paragraph">To start working with Parsley you need to add several of its SWCs to your classpath first.
Which ones you'll need depends on the feature set you'll be using and whether you'll be building
a Flex or Flash Application. See <a href="overview.php#dependencies">1.5&nbsp;Dependencies</a> for details.</p>

<p class="paragraph">To get started take the Parsley Core download and add the required SWCs from the
release and dependencies folders to your classpath.
You'll find them in the <code>release</code> folder of the download Zip.</p>



<p class="subheadline"> Minimum Set of Required SWCs </p>

<p class="paragraph">You always need:</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>parsley-core-${version}.swc</code> </li>
<li> <code>spicelib-commands-${version}.swc</code> </li>
<li> <code>spicelib-reflect-${version}.swc</code> </li>
<li> <code>spicelib-util-${version}.swc</code> </li>
</ul>



<p class="subheadline"> Additional SWC for Flex </p>

<p class="paragraph">For Flex you'd also need:</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>parsley-flex-${version}.swc</code> </li>
</ul>



<p class="subheadline"> Additional SWCs for XML Configuration </p>

<p class="paragraph">Only when using XML configuration you'd also need to add:</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>parsley-xml-${version}.swc</code> </li>
<li> <code>spicelib-xml-mapper-${version}.swc</code> </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="dependencies"></a>2.3 Defining Object Dependencies</h2>

<p class="paragraph">This is probably the most frequently used feature of Parsley. Dependencies can be configured
with Metadata, MXML, XML or programmatically.</p>

<p class="subheadline"> Using the <code>[Inject]</code> metadata tag </p>

<p class="paragraph">You can use the tag on properties:</p>

<pre><code>[Inject]
public var loginService:LoginService;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>[Inject]
public function set loginService (service:LoginService) : void {
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">Or you can use it on methods to declare multiple dependencies at once:</p>

<pre><code>[Inject]
public function init (loginService:LoginService, cartService:CartService = null) : void {
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">The nice thing in the example above is that Parsley will also reflect on the parameter types
and treat optional parameters as optional dependencies. So in this example the container will throw an 
Error if the <code>LoginService</code> is missing, but silently skip the <code>CartService</code> if it is
not present in the container.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Finally you can also use a similar tag (<code>[InjectConstructor]</code>) on the class declaration
for constructor injection (as the Flex compiler ignores metadata on constructors):</p>

<pre><code>[InjectConstructor]
public class LoginAction {

    function LoginAction (loginService:LoginService, cartService:CartService = null) : void {
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">Again the second (optional) parameter will treated as an optional dependency accordingly</p>
 

<p class="subheadline"> Best Practices </p>

<p class="paragraph">In all the examples we showed in this section the dependencies will be selected by type,
since Parsley will reflect on the property and method parameter types. To benefit from the decoupling
that an IOC Container offers you should prefer to declare interface types at injection points.
This way you can switch implementations in the configuration without touching the injection
points of classes that need these services.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Of course this only works when you add only a single object matching the type at the
injection point to the container. If you have several implementation of the same interface
you'd need to switch to injection by id instead which is only available for properties:</p>

<pre><code>[Inject(id="mainLoginService")]
public var loginService:LoginService;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">The choice between property, method or constructor injection is up to you. Some prefer
constructor injection as it enables better encapsulation, allowing you to create immutable classes.
But constructor injection is only recommended if you target Flash Player 10.1 or newer as earlier
players had reflection bugs on constructors.</p>

<p class="paragraph">See <a href="injection.php#intro">4&nbsp;Dependency Injection</a> for more details on injection in general.</p>
<h2><a name="messaging"></a>2.4 Sending and Receiving Messages</h2>

<p class="paragraph">While Dependency Injection already allows some level of decoupling if you declare injection
points with interface types, for some parts of the application you'll prefer even looser coupling,
letting the parts of your application communicate through messages, without the sender and receiving
objects having to know each other.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For example you might transform low-level view events into calls to a presentation model which 
dispatches application messages, so that any action/controller
can register for all message types it is interested in.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For more details on this topic see <a href="messaging.php#intro">6&nbsp;Messaging</a> and <a href="mvc.php#intro">11&nbsp;Building MVC Architectures</a>.</p>

<p class="paragraph">With Parsley you can configure the sending as well as the receiving side with metadata tags.
The sending part may simply contain a <code>[MessageDispatcher]</code> tag on a public function
property:</p>

<pre><code><span style="color:#FF0000;">[MessageDispatcher]</span>
public var dispatcher: Function;

public class LoginServiceImpl implements LoginService {

    [...]
    
    private function handleLoginResult (user:User) : void {
        <span style="color:#FF0000;">dispatcher(new LoginMessage(user));</span>
    }
    
}
</code></pre> 

<p class="paragraph">Here we use the injected dispatcher function to send an instance of <code>LoginMessage</code>.
With Parsley messages do not need to extend the Event class (although they could if they'd need to).</p>

<p class="paragraph">For the receiving side you can use the <code>[MessageHandler]</code> tag to signal interest in a particular
message type, determined by the parameter type of the method:</p>

<pre><code>[MessageHandler]
public function login (event:LoginEvent) : void {
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">Like with Dependency Injection selecting the message receivers by type improves the robustness of the system
as you don't have to take care of unique event type String constants for the whole system.</p>

<p class="paragraph">There are more tags for the receiving side like the <code>[MessageBinding]</code> tag.
Those will be explained in <a href="messaging.php#intro">6&nbsp;Messaging</a>.</p> 
<h2><a name="assembling"></a>2.5 Assembling the Objects</h2>

<p class="paragraph">There are a lot more configuration options in addition to the tags for Dependency Injection and Messaging.
But since those are the most common ones we'll now show you how you assemble these objects for the IOC Container. 
After you added metadata tags to the classes you have to tell the container which objects it should manage.</p>


<p class="subheadline"> Flex Applications </p>

<p class="paragraph">In Flex you might want to prefer MXML configuration. You can create a simple MXML class (using <code>&lt;Objects&gt;</code>
from the Parsley namespace as the root tag) and add all the classes you want to be managed by Parsley:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Objects
    xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
    xmlns="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley"
    xmlns:services="com.bookstore.services.*"
    xmlns:actions="com.bookstore.actions.*"&gt;
    
    &lt;fx:Declarations&gt;
    
        &lt;services:LoginServiceImpl timeout="3000"/&gt;

        &lt;services:CartServiceImpl timeout="3000"/&gt;
    
        &lt;actions:LoginAction/&gt;

        &lt;actions:AddToCartAction/&gt;

        &lt;actions:DeleteCartAction/&gt;
        
    &lt;/fx:Declarations&gt;
    
&lt;/Objects&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">Of course you can also use this configuration file for setting additional property values. They will be combined
with the processing of the metadata tags for all classes added to the container.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In this example we didn't specify any id attributes. If you just use injection by type you don't need them.
In case you use ids at injection points like in the last example of the section on injection you have to specify them
here:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;services:AdminLoginServiceImpl id="adminLogin" timeout="3000"/&gt;
&lt;services:UserLoginServiceImpl id="userService" timeout="3000"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">You can then use those ids at injection points:</p>

<pre><code>[Inject(id="adminLogin")]
public var adminLogin:LoginService;

[Inject(id="userLogin")]
public var userLogin:LoginService;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">But in general you should try to avoid injection by id and only use it where you work with multiple instances
of the same type.</p>


<p class="subheadline"> Flash Applications </p>

<p class="paragraph">In this case MXML is not available. So the preferred configuration mechanism is probably the use of XML files.
Of course you can also use external XML files in Flex Applications if you don't want to compile the configuration
into your application.</p>

<p class="paragraph">An example XML configuration corresponding to the MXML example above would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;objects 
    xmlns="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley 
        http://www.spicefactory.org/parsley/schema/2.3/parsley-core.xsd"
    &gt;
    
    &lt;object type="com.bookstore.services.LoginServiceImpl"&gt;
        &lt;property name="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
    
    &lt;object type="com.bookstore.services.CartServiceImpl"&gt;
        &lt;property name="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
    
    &lt;object type="com.bookstore.actions.LoginAction"/&gt;

    &lt;object type="com.bookstore.actions.AddToCartAction"/&gt;

    &lt;object type="com.bookstore.actions.DeleteCartAction"/&gt;
&lt;/objects&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">Like with the MXML example we don't specify an id for the object definitions. You can add it if required
for injection by id.</p>

<p class="paragraph">These are the most common options for assembling the objects. You'll find many more examples in <a href="config.php#intro">3&nbsp;Configuration and Initialization</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="initialize"></a>2.6 Initializing the Framework</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Now that you configured your classes with metadata tags and assembled them in MXML or XML, it's finally
time to intialize the whole thing. Fortunately in most cases this is a one liner or a simple tag.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For the MXML configuration file we created, assuming that we called it <code>BookStoreConfig.mxml</code>,
the tag would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;parsley:ContextBuilder config="{BookStoreConfig}"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">That's all there is to it.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For the XML example we have to initialize the Context programmatically in a Flash application:</p>

<pre><code>XmlContextBuilder.build("config.xml");
</code></pre>

<p class="paragraph">We covered the most common use cases here. There are a lot more options like splitting
the configuration into multiple files or even using different configuration mechanisms like MXML and XML
in the same application and merging them to a single context. This will be demonstrated in <a href="config.php#combine">3.7&nbsp;Combining multiple Configuration mechanisms</a>.</p>

<p class="paragraph">For modular applications you wouldn't want to lump everything together into a single monolithic context and
load all this stuff on application start. For building modular applications and loading and unloading configurations
on demand see <a href="modules.php#intro">10&nbsp;Building Modular Applications</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="more"></a>2.7 Adding more Services</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Since this is the Getting Started section we only covered the most common use cases.
But hopefully for simple applications it is sufficient to get you going.
As you may have noticed already the manual is quite extensive and if you think you need
a lot more options than covered in this chapter you should browse the remaining chapters.</p> 

<p class="paragraph">If you just want to get an idea of the feature set Parsley offers you may want to start with
<a href="overview.php#features">1.1&nbsp;Features List</a>.</p> 

<p class="paragraph">The most interesting options not covered in this chapter are probably:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="config.php#dsl">3.5&nbsp;Configuration DSL</a> and <a href="config.php#as3">3.6&nbsp;ActionScript Configuration</a>: You are not limited to configuration with Metadata, MXML or XML, there
are two more options, which give you additional flexibility. </li>

<li> <a href="messaging.php#interceptors">6.7&nbsp;Intercepting Messages</a>: A <code>MessageHandlers</code> as covered
in this chapter even allows you to interfere with the message dispatching process (e.g. suspending
and resuming or cancelling the message processing). </li>

<li> <a href="managedcommands.php#intro">7&nbsp;Managed Commands</a>: You can execute Commands in a way that they are managed
by the container for the time they execute. </li>

<li> <a href="lifecycle.php#factories">8.2&nbsp;Using Factories</a>: Instead of assembling the target objects itself you can also add
factories to the IOC Container which create objects, which gives you additional flexibility on how
objects are instantiated. </li>

<li> <a href="lifecycle.php#async">8.3&nbsp;Asynchronous Object Initialization</a>: Configuration option for asynchronously initializing objects (e.g. objects
that need to load data before they can operate). In this case the container will defer the initialization
of other objects until those configured to be asynchronous are ready. </li>

<li> <a href="view.php#intro">9&nbsp;Dynamic View Wiring</a>: We already mentioned this one briefly. Allows you to wire Flex Components defined
in MXML to objects declared in the IOC Container. </li>

<li> <a href="modules.php#intro">10&nbsp;Building Modular Applications</a>: Associate configured services, actions, presentation models and so on with a configuration Context
that can be loaded and unloaded on demand. </li>

<li> <a href="resources.php#bindings">12.1&nbsp;ResourceBindings</a>: For binding properties of managed objects to localized resources, updating them automatically
when the localeChain changes. </li>

<li> <a href="extensions.php#intro">13&nbsp;Extending the Framework</a>: If you want to add your own Metadata, MXML or XML configuration tags or use
some of the other available extension points.
Useful for simplifying recurring configuration tasks or for creating frameworks on top of Parsley. </li>
</ul>
