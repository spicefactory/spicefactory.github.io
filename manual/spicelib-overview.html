<h1><a name="intro"></a>18 Spicelib Overview</h1>

<p class="paragraph">Spicelib is a suite of AS3 libraries that can be used in Flex or pure AS3 projects.
This chapter will give a quick overview over the available projects.</p>
<h2><a name="purpose"></a>18.1 Purpose of the library</h2>

<p class="paragraph">The focus for Spicelib is on general utility modules for AS3
development. Furthermore Spicelib serves as a support library for the other Spicefactory projects.
So if you are using Parsley, Pimento or Cinnamon there are always Spicelib modules working
under the hood. But they are completely independent and can be used without these other higher
level frameworks (and also do not depend on each other, with a few exceptions).</p>
<h2><a name="projects"></a>18.2 Spicelib Projects</h2>

<p class="paragraph">Spicelib consists of the following projects:</p>

<p class="subheadline"> Reflection </p>

<p class="paragraph">The reflection library contains convenient classes to reflect on AS3 classes,
methods and properties without the need for cumbersome parsing of XML output from 
<code>describeType</code>. It includes convenient mechanism of mapping metadata 
tags to concrete classes, to overcome the lack of type-safety of
AS3 metadata. All in all it is a library that should have been part of the core APIs
of the Flash Player.
For more information see <a href="reflection.php#intro">19&nbsp;Reflection</a>.</p>

<p class="subheadline"> XML to Object Mapper </p>

<p class="paragraph">A small but powerful and flexibel XML-to-Object Mapper which allows you to map from XML 
to AS3 classes - in both directions. It comes with builtin mappers
which cover the most common use cases like mapping properties of AS3 classes to XML attributes
or child elements, but can be easily extended. For more information see <a href="xmlmapper.php#intro">20&nbsp;XML to Object Mapper</a>.</p>

<p class="subheadline"> Command Framework </p>

<p class="paragraph">A general abstraction for asynchronous operations. Allows grouping of
commands for sequential or parallel execution and passing data from command
results to subsequent commands in a decoupled fashion. For more information see <a href="commands.php#intro">21&nbsp;The Command Framework</a>.</p>

<p class="subheadline"> Logging </p>

<p class="paragraph">The logging framework allows to log custom messages from application code and use 
the configuration options to filter log output based on logger names (often corresponding
to the name of the class containing the log statement) and log levels as a way to indicate
the severity or importance of the log message. 
For more information see <a href="spicelib-logging.php#intro">22&nbsp;Logging for Flash Applications</a>.</p> 
<h2><a name="dependencies"></a>18.3 Project Dependencies</h2>

<p class="paragraph">This table lists the dependencies required for each of the projects.
The dependencies are always included in the downloads of library releases.</p>
